<h2>The denton creative community needs a boost!</h2>
<h3>Let's use modern tools to get a leading edge on those with financial backing!</h3>
<p>The first mistake that people usually make in business is focusing on the solution rather than the problem.</p>
<p>If we spend some time figuring out what the problems of the local denton creative community are, we can figure out from there which problems to try and solve first.</p>
<p>From there, we try to solve the most critical problems with the least difficult solutions and that's how you ensure that we'll make something that is usefull to our community :) at the least cost!</p>
