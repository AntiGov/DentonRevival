<p>This book will give insight on how to state and vet problems and solutions, to find the most effective combinations. Just simply stating well thought out problems and solutions is a big contribution.</p>
<p>If you wanna get your hands dirty with some code, I have it hosted on github <a href="https://github.com/Neobii/DentonRevival">here</a>.  I use Meteor for the webapp and any contributions are welcome!</p>
