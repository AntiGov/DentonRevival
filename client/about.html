<p>Rubber Gloves Rehearsal Studios, *tears* this is a huge loss for Denton. A lot of people just think this was a place to play and listen to shows. However, it also provided infrastructure and an open canvas that anyone could practice and play / learn music with it's many rehearsal studios. At the same time, a huge win for Denton, KUZU, has emerged so all hope isn't lost; it's just a sign to dig in and take some responsibility for our changing Denton.</p>
<p>I think without Rubber Gloves there's going to be a huge gap in local creative infrastructure, and many people are thinking / offering ways to fix it. There are also some new players in Denton that seem to want to replace our culture and are winning because they have capital / business backing and the infrastructure to execute.</p>
<p>I, myself, can't produce a physical space that would even come close to the value of what Rubber Gloves contributed. However I can attempt to create tools for infrastructure so there is an easy way to match local artists with a place to show their art or other things. That's just an idea, and that being said, ideas are cheap and the magic actually happens in execution. Also, I'm not sure if that's the biggest problem the local artist community is facing.</p>
<p>In short, we gotta up our game and use modern business tools / methodologies to help give us a voice and produce the most effective ways for us, as artists, to collaborate and share.</p>
