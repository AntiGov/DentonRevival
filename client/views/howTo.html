	<h3>The gist...</h3>
	<p>Denton is growing, that can be a good thing! Often, the creative community isn't armed with the tools of business and, sadly, get outpaced by more some of the more imperial habitants.  With a good infastructure, we can fast track or reduce overhead the things we care about most.</p>
	<h3>Lean Methodology</h3>
	<p>How do we get the most valuable stuff out that people at the lowest cost? That's where lean comes in, it's my guide to making stuff that people actually want!</p>
	<p>One of the first mistakes that lean points out, is that we spend an inproportionate amount of time on our solution and our problems should actually be given more thought!  If we can figure out what our biggest problems are, we can brainstorm solutions to figure out simplest way to fix them.</p>
	<h3>Segments</h3>
	<p> Musicians, artists, caterers and the many other creative venues in denton are definately going to have different sets of problems and should be categorized as so.  However, these segments can work together because a solution can come from any segment.</p>
	<h3>Problems</h3>
	<p>Vote on current problems or add a new problem.  If a problem falls below -5 votes it will be removed from the system.  There is no way to edit problems, if a better way to state a problem comes about, it should be put on a new problem and voted on accordingly.</p>
	<h3>Solutions</h3>
	<p>If you click on a problem, you will be able to see a list of proposed solutions for the problem and vote on them / leave comments</p>
	<h3>Solutions - Todos</h3>
	<p>When we figure out a specific solution, we'll break it into a todo list and keep track of when they are finished!</p>
	<h3>Comments</h3>
	<p>Hopefully there will be much discussion on how to make this thang better! I'm going to try and be a lean referee, but any discourse is accepted!</p>
